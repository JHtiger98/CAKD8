       "  'From: muirm@argon.gas.organpipe.uug.arizona.edu (maxwell c muir)\\nSubject: Re: Homosexuality issues in Christianity\\nOrganization: University of Arizona, Tucson\\nLines: 75\\n\\nCan someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other\\nthan Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\\nignored by Christians (haven\\'t seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\\n\\nLater,\\nMax (Bob) Muir\\n\\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\\ncited passages are:\\n\\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\\nthere\\'s no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn\\'t seem to have been known\\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\\nabout homosexuality.\\n\\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul\\'s letters.  In Rom\\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\\nNote that the passage isn\\'t about homosexuality -- it\\'s about\\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\\nSo it\\'s not what I\\'d call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\\n1:10.  Unfortunately it\\'s not entirely clear what the words used here\\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\\nprostitute\".  Again, we don\\'t have here a precise teaching about\\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\\nshared the OT\\'s negative judgement on homosexuality.\\n\\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it\\'s probably not relevant.  The\\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\\nintercourse with angels.\\n\\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people\\'s conclusion is\\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\\nthe passages from Paul\\'s letters imply that he accepted the OT\\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there\\'s no specific teaching, and no\\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\\n\\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it\\'s\\nclear to me that that\\'s mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\\nappears to depend upon one\\'s reaction to the message of the Bible as a\\nwhole, as well as one\\'s perception of the needs of the church today.\\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\\nother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things\\nvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic\\noutcome is not very likely...\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

This I appreciated very\\nmuch . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO \\ninformation out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics\\nprogrammer. The subjects are\\n\\n\\t1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I\\nknow somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to\\ndothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books\\nand info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a\\nway to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in\\nassembly, which I don\\'t know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get\\nany speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?\\n\\n\\t2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what\\nthe net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of\\nthe advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will\\ntell me in \"mostly plain\" english how the vesa calls work.\\n\\n\\tMy biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,\\nI have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both\\ngopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is\\nsome lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of\\nprogrammiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling\\nyou how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I\\nknow there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where\\nare you, and why haven\\'t you written a book yet? \\n\\nPlease help\\n\\nThanks in advance\\n\\nStephen palm\\npalm@snycanva.bitnet\\n(please send all personal replies to the above address, thanks)\\n\\n',\n",

In other\\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n',\n",

It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N.

It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.

       "  'Subject: Space FAQ 02/15 - Network Resources\\nFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)\\nExpires: 6 May 1993 19:54:26 GMT\\nOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\\nKeywords: Frequently Asked Questions\\nSupersedes: <net_730956391@cs.unc.edu>\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.edu\\nLines: 241\\n\\nArchive-name: space/net\\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $\\n\\nNETWORK RESOURCES\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of\\n    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In\\n    general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three\\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\\n    special \\'servers\\'.\\n\\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\\n\\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\\n\\n    A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\\n    \\'group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\\n    called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\',\\n    and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called\\n    \\'articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\\n    posted.\\n\\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\\n    it the preferred option.\\n\\nMAILING LISTS\\n\\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\\n    should be in the format \\'subscribe space John Public\\') to join. Note\\n    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of\\n    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are\\n    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve\\n\\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README\\n    for further details.\\n\\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\\n    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.\\n\\n    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning\\n    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to\\n    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.\\n\\n    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in\\n    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.\\n\\n    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;\\n    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid\\n    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to\\n    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and\\n    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from\\n    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,\\n    or by email to space-tech-request if you don\\'t have FTP access.\\n\\n    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and\\n    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email\\n    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your\\n    name\". Email saying \"INDEX SEDS-L\" to list the archive contents.\\n\\n    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status\\n    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in\\n    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email\\n    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying \"SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name\" to join.\\n    Email saying \"INDEX SEDSNEWS\" to list the archive contents.\\n\\n    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which\\n    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him\\n    to join the list.\\n\\n    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a\\n    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate\\n    \\'please remove me from this list\\' messages which are sent to the list\\n    address rather than the request address.\\n\\nPERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION\\n\\n    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is\\n    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group\\n    sci.space.news created for this purpose).

However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II\\nfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes\\nto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he\\ncan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.

Before he became a priest he was an\\nactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner\\nand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner\\'s indications.  Part\\nof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,\\ngoing to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another\\nPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about\\nAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask\\nhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, \\n\"Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in \\nreincarnation,\" and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times\\nto modern times.

It\\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\\n\\n|> \\n|> What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\\n|> we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\\n|> Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\\n\\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\\nshot.\\n\\n|> \\n|> I\\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\\n|> previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\\n|> for a while, rather than being flushed.\\n\\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\\'85-\\'89), the PI\\n(\\'88-\\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\\'s - \\'86-\\'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems (\\'88-\\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon\\'t, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\\'t wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it\\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\\n|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\\n|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\\n|> just before the end of the quarter), but I\\'m just a little tired of\\n|> getting boned in the process.\\n|> \\n\\nIf that\\'s happening, it\\'s becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n|> Maybe it\\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\\n|> aren\\'t entitled to a \"peek under the covers\" as the Big Kids (NASA,\\n|> for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs\\n|> and organizations, doesn\\'t have a load of money to spend on computers\\n|> every year, so we can\\'t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.\\n\\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\\ncommitments.\\n\\n|> The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the\\n|> entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.

There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary\\nevidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.\\nFurther, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is \"No\\nMartyrs for a Lie\": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather\\nthan recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the\\nquite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered\\nthe chance of life by recanting.  Since we don\\'t even know how or\\nwhere they died, we certainly don\\'t have this information.  (By the\\nway, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could\\nhave saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers\\nto die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is\\nwell-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.

I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren\\'t morally \\nresponsible\", perhaps because I\\'ve heard it misused so many times.\\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\\nmost folk can\\'t control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I\\'m not sure what\\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\\npart of that.\\n\\n>Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n>1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\\n>applies beyond what might be called \\'mental hygiene\\', that is, not trying\\n>to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\\n>thoughts.\\nI don\\'t know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I\\'ve had dreams, some\\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that\\nextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably\\nmuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,\\nthan to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by\\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\\n\\n>2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are \\'another plane\\')\\n>Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\n>common by more than one person.\\nWhat on Earth is your definition of \"often\"? I know exactly one case of\\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\\nsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only \"other plane\" I\\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don\\'t think *anyone\\'s* dreams,\\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet\\'s, represent actual actions on an\\nalternate plane.

For a Christian won\\'t\\nit *always* come down to \"what Jesus would have us do?\"\\n\\n>So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\\n>of another alternative?  respond by post or email.\\nTruth? I don\\'t claim to be an expert in dreams. I\\'ll note that the Bible\\ndoesn\\'t talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.\\n\\nI would discount talk of \"alternate planes,\" though. The only places such\\nconcepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to\\nChristianity, though I\\'ve run into the occasional exception. If you are,\\nor want to be, a Christian, you want to be very careful about ideas like\\nthis. \\n',\n",

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey\\'s Role in\\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\\n\\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\\n\\nShaw: Basically, I\\'m  an Ottoman historian, but  I\\'m also Jewish.\\nI\\'ve  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\\n\\n- How exactly did they do this?\\n\\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\\nNazis\\' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\\nto be a Turkish Jew.\\n\\n- How so?\\n\\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\\nYou  can\\'t do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\\n\\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\\nParis,  and that\\'s  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\\nconsuls took place.\\n\\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\\nconsuls couldn\\'t declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\\n\\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\\n\\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\\n\\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\\ngovernments really didn\\'t want the Jews to escape. As a result of\\nthe Turkish consuls\\' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\\n\\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\\nfrom Nazi persecution.\\n\\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\\ncouldn\\'t do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\\nthat  time people  didn\\'t know  what  was going  on. They  didn\\'t\\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren\\'t able to help much in\\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\\n\\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\\nsend money and food out of the country.\\n\\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\\nliving in Israel.\\n\\nYes, and  their children. But  let\\'s return  for a moment  to the\\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\\n\\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\\n\\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\\n\\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\\n\\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\\ncould see the documents.\\n\\n- What languages are used in the documents?\\n\\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale\\'s  department store in New York\\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\\n\\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn\\'t\\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\\nsomeday will make the effort.\\n\\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nRight. I\\'m  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I\\'ve been actively\\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\\n\\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\\n\\nI\\'m working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\\nall sorts of political movements.\\n\\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\\nHolocaust: Turkey\\'s  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

This report\\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\\n\\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\\n  since the last report.\\n\\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\\n\\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\\n\\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\\n\\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\\n  was $8,638,133.15.\\n\\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\\n  1992.\\n\\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\\n  claims in early 1994.\\n\\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran\\'s claim\\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\\n\\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda\\'s resignation will\\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\\n  his duties.\\n\\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran\\'s policy behavior\\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\\n  Congress on significant developments.\\n\\n\\n                         WILLIAM J.

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \\n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\\n\\n Switzerland:\\n\\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\\n              31 Samuel Balmer\\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\\n \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\\n\\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\\n Attendance: 8,600\\n\\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\\n\\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\\n \\n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\\n\\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

Biomedical research doesn\\'t make any basic \\nassumptions that aren\\'t the same as any other discipline of scientific\\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \\n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".

If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.

My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.

Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for\\nthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as\\nthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture\\nquality if your dithering works right).\\n\\nI can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to\\nGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.\\nYou don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA\\ncard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+\\ncomputers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a\\n8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write\\nsome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other\\ncolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg\\ndithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette\\nthe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would\\nwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but\\nit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way\\ngives a brighter more detailed image.\\n\\nAnyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as\\nfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the\\nVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)\\n\\nHave a day!\\n\\nGerry.\\n\",\n",

I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\\n\\nI eagerly await comment.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He\\'s hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I\\'m a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\\n                                                                                       \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\\n\\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\\n\\n>As a non-believer, I find Michael\\'s Christianity kinder and gentler.\\n\\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n>If I take him at\\n>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were\\n>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one\\'s fellow\\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\\n>loving god? \\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\n>I am glad that a few Christians,\\n>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then\\n>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive\\n>fashion.

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n>Studies by the \\n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.

Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental.

The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\\n\\n>In my studies\\n>of the ancient mystery reliegions, I have run across many poems or rituals or\\n>what nots with the interpretation that those who are of God will be with Him\\n>via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer *eternal* life in dieing.\\n> It was a standard belief back then.  \\n\\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\\n\\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\\nthe sense world.\\n\\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\\npeople\\'s ideas of life after death.\\n\\n>                                    Today we think we know so much and that\\n>if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two. \\n>But I think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a\\n>mist, not those of the older ages.\\n>\\n\\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\\ntime\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\\nmuch more as well.\\n\\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\\nviews on this subject).\\n\\n>I have said it before, I\\'d love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would\\n>fall.  The history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in England to the\\n>Greeks who pilaged it from the Egyptians who ultimately got it from the\\n>Babylonian mysteries. And yes, the eastern religions also show many\\n>similarities.  I mean, its black and white.  THe writings and the archeological\\n>finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine.  \\n\\nThe way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\\nteachings today can be received.\\n\\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\\nexpression of the different people\\'s ideas of the time immediately\\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\\n\\n>maybe at sometime in the future-  \\n\\nIndeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\\nterms that did not try to spell it out.\\n\\n>Rex\\n\\nGerry (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\\'s in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \\nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \\nbad. I didn\\'t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \\nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\nArmenians. There isn\\'t an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren\\'t any\\nArmenians left. \\'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \\nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means I\\'m an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \\nme. I say, \"I\\'m 47.\" \"I\\'m 47 too, but I call you \\'old man\\'.\" I say, \"It \\ndepends on God, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" I look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nWe\\'re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no Armenians with us.\\n\\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an Armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\\'m an Armenian, but I speak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \\npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \\n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We\\'re\\nAzerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you\\'re an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\\'s where the Kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\\'s the beginning of down-town. I \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \\nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\\n\\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. I\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\nI can\\'t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \\ndoing I can\\'t say, because I couldn\\'t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   April 20, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

And those of us who are fighting for the right to life\\nof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or\\ncrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God\\nhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.\\n\\n\\nTHE IMPRECATORY PSALMS\\n\\nEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for\\njudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to\\nrespond to them. Prayers such as:\\n\"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\\nhis wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\\nmotivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever;\\nthe nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the\\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\\nsuffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\\nmay terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)\\n\\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your\\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O\\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\"\\n95:1-2; \"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely\\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\\njudges the earth.\\'\" 58:6-11\\n\\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\\nfor God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?\\n\\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\"\\nand \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\\nspeaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They\\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5-\\n6; \"With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\\nagainst those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You\\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\\nLord abhors.\" 5:5-6.\\n\\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\\n\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;\\n\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\\ngo on in their sins\" 68:21.\\n\\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then\\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"\\n59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow\\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows\\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\\nthat is due You. \" 90:11\\n\\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\\nimprecations (prayers invoking God\\'s righteous judgement upon the\\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\\nmore common.\\n\\n\\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\\n\\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\\npray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation\\n6:10).\\n\\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\\nNeto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had\\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\\nHe boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won\\'t be a Bible or a\\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet\\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\\nMoscow.\\n\\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\\n     crash the very next day.\\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\\n     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20\\n\\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the\\nantiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was\\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\\nRomania.\\n\\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\\nthe 1960\\'s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\\nMozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and\\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\\n\\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\\nMozambique, Machel\\'s Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa\\'s\\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\\ncountry.\\n\\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\\ndeclared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox\\'s\\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand\".\\n\\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\\n\\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\\nunbanned!\\n\\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC\\'s \"military\\nwing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword\\nwill die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.\\n\\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\\nand limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told\\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn\\'t hate him, I did\\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\\nwas an atheist.\\n\\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\\nkillers of preborn babies.\\n\\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\\n\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\\nto evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\\n\\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War\\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\\nPsalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\\nReformed Publishing Company):\\n\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\\n\\n\\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\\n\\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\\n\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God\\n\\'s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus\\'\\nteaching that we should love our enemies. \"\\n\\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\\n\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"\\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\\n\\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\\nis to impudently take the place of God.\\n\\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\\nhave led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\\nit their job to \"clean up\" God\\'s Word according to their own\\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\\nauthority of God\\'s Word (like Eve\\'s original sin of listening to\\nSatan\\'s question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").\\n\\nThe Psalms are part of God\\'s revelation of Himself and His\\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"\\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\\n\\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\\nPs 109):\\n\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\\nspeak to us therein. \"\\n\\nThe rejection of any part of God\\'s Word is a rejection of the\\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\\n\\n\\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\\n\\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\\nthe Last Supper.\\n\\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\\nwords - the words of the Lord\\'s Anointed - which as David\\'s Son\\nHe truly was.\\n\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5\\n\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1\\n\\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\\nMatt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, \\'I never knew you. Away\\nfrom me, you evildoers\\'. \" Ps 6:8\\n\\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\\n\\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\\n\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\\nresurrection of Christ. \"\\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\\nforerunner David.\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\\nfor the wronged.\\n\\n\\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\\n\\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\\n53).\\n\\n\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\\nmight become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21\\n\\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\\nHis enemies.\\n\\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God\\'s Word is revealed\\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God\\'s way of\\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\\nof God.\\n\\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\\n\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\\nfor the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41\\n\\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God\\'s\\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\\nwill reign forever!\\n\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"\\nRev 19 : 15\\n\\n\\n4. Are Jesus\\' prayers contradictory?\\n\\nWhat about Jesus\\' command to love our enemies and to bless those\\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\\n\\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\\non those who disobey His Gospel.\\n\\n\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\\nbelieved. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10\\n\\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\\n\\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\\n\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"\\nMatt 23\\n\\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\\nbetrayal by Judas.\\n\\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ\\'s prayers of blessing are\\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\\n\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God\\'s Word ... and have\\n\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\\nmessage of God\\'s kingdom will be judged.)\\n\\n\\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\\n\\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy\\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all\\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: \\'Curses, maledictions\\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\\nwisdom and plans run aground\\' . \"\\n\\nTo pray tor the extension of God\\'s kingdom is to solicit the\\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of\\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\\nwill itself endure forever. \"\\n\\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\\n\\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan\\'s kingdom from its love for God\\'s\\nkingdom. God\\'s kingdom cannot come without satan\\'s kingdom being\\ndestroyed. God\\'s will cannot be done on earth without the\\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\\n\\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot\\ntogether\" against God and His people:\\n\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\\nrefuse on the ground. \"\\n\\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\\nprovides a vivid example of God\\'s judgement on the wicked. Sisera\\n\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they\\n\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those\\nprayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"\\nJudges 4:15-16\\n\\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As\\nyou did to Sisera ...\"\\n\\n\\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\\n     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"\\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\\n\\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\\nan awesome account:\\n\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\\nvoice:\\n\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman\\'s hands - and\\nsets it up in secret. \"\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"\\n\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\\n\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour\\'s boundary stone...\\n\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\\n\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\\nfatherless or the widow...\\n\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\\n\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\\nperson.\\n\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\\ncarrying them out.\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26\\n\\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\\nrejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the\\nLord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22\\n\\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\\n31; 12:14-29.)\\n\\n\\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\\n\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\\nonto the battlefield?\\n\\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church\\'s\\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general\\'s orders.\\nThe pastor\\'s charge is of greater importance than that of a\\ncourier in any earthly army. There\\'s no place tor the dispatcher\\nto decide he doesn\\'t agree with his Commander\\'s strategy.\\n\\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God\\'s Kingdom (Lk\\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God\\'s\\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\\nGod\\'s rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\\ninto its \\'streets and say, \\'Even the dust of your town that\\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\\nThe kingdom of God is near\"\\' Luke 10:11.\\n\\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\\nauthority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to\\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\\nhim who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\\ncalling down God\\'s curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\\nagainst God\\'s authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\\nHis servants.\\n\\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\\nwill be inevitable.\\n\\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\\nbreakers is real.\\n\\nThe \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms\\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\\nChrist\\'s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\\nanswer the psalmist\\'s prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\\nHe will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"\\nLuke 19:27.\\n\\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God\\'s\\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword\\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-\\nreadiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\\n\\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the\\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\\ncall on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.\\n\\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\\nis necessary for us to pray for God\\'s justice. Those who are\\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\\n\\n\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps\\n149:5-9\\n\\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\\nnf God to destroy evil.\\n\\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\\nJesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\\nthe waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.\\n\\nThe full book \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace \" is available,\\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.\\n\\n\\nPERMISSION TO REPRODUCE\\nThose wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of FF News\\nare encouraged to do so.

It is more than 99 percent \\neffective.\\n\\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \\npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \\ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \\nmissing a daily dose.\"\\n\\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \\nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \\nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \\ninjections.\\n\\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \\nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \\nbefore making a decision to use it.\\n\\nDepo Provera\\'s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \\nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \\nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \\nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\\n\\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \\naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \\ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \\nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \\nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\\n\\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \\ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \\nosteoporosis.

Sullivan, M.D. \"The effort \\nto accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and \\nindeed a hallmark of this administration.\" \\n\\nThese rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to \\napprove a drug based on \"surrogate endpoints\" or markers.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment.

It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease. By \\nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease). \\n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \\nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \\nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \\ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans.

These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \\ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\\nthe book they\\'re talking about -- they compare the two things section\\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \\nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \\nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \\nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\\nlaw; and sure enough, that\\'s what the whole thing has mutated into, \\nurban-folklore style.\\n\\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \\ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \\nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don\\'t \\nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \\nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \\nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\\n\\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\\nlaw registry].\"\\n\\nBingo.  Exactly.  \\n\\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author\\'s admission.  He\\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \\nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \\nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there\\'s absolutely no reason to \\nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \\nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \\nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \\nherrings.\\n\\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \\nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \\nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \\nto have things translated when they *don\\'t know what they mean*.  If Dodd \\ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \\nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \\nwouldn\\'t he?\\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn\\'t they have any idea how to do it\\non their own?\\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \\nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd\\'s motivation isn\\'t a \\nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\\n\\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \\nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \\n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \\nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \\nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \\ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \\n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA\\'68...\" -- so \\nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-- Don Porges\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t..uunet!inmet!porges\\n',\n",

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\n\\n- end -\\n     \\n',\n",

       "  'From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\\nSubject: etymology of \"Easter\"\\nLines: 53\\n\\nfor SRC\\n\\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \"Passover.\" In English,\\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\\norigin of this term.\\n\\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\\nnot make it more so.\\n\\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\\nFestival.\"\\n\\nHowever, Bede\\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\\n\\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n\\n\\n[No, I\\'m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\\nof celebrating Easter.

Anesthetic\\nagents\\n>can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out\\nof\\n>the body as easily.\\n\\nThe original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital\\nbut I can answer a few general points.\\n\\nElderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after\\nbeing in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment\\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\\n\\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\\npatients early.\\n\\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\\n\\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing\\nmore it is hard to comment.\\n\\nDon Mackie - his opinions\\nesiology will disavow...\\n\",\n",

This article\\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\\n\\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\\nprobably not good enough.\\n\\nListserv:\\n\\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\\n\\nThe Alias file:\\n\\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\\n\\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\\n\\n\\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo\\' on that host is\\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\\npossible email list is \\n\\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\\n\\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin\\'s home directory,\\nowned by the list admin.\\n\\nBounced Mail:\\n\\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\\nby the way.  I\\'m not sure where he got it from.)\\n\\n\\nschool-request:   welty\\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list\\nschool: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\"\\nowner-school: school-request\\nowner-school-out: school-request\\n\\n\\nhere\\'s what is going on here:\\n\\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\\nof contact for administrative duties.\\n\\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\\nactual list members.\\n\\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\\n\\n-----------------\\n#!/bin/sh\\ncd /tmp\\nsed -e \\'/^Reply-To:/d\\' -e \\'/^Sender:/d\\' -e \\'/^From /d\\' | \\\\\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\\\n         cat -) | \\\\\\n        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\\nexit 0\\n-------------------\\n\\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\\n\\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\\nHopefully I\\'ll be able to provide more information in a future version\\nof this posting.\\n\\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis\\'\\'  -- Carroll Smith\\n',\n",

Similarly,\\n   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum\\n   for SCO products in general.\\n   \\n   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO\\n   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been\\n   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt\\n   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*\\n   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.\\n\\n   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in\\n   accordance with accepted procedure within \"biz\".  Given the content,\\n   this change relocated the \"opendesktop\" newsgroup to a more proper place\\n   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new \"announce\"\\n   and \"general\" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former \"sco-list@uunet.uu.net\"\\n   became \"scogen\" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.\\n\\n   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992\\n   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific\\n   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are\\n   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy\\n   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.\\n   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to\\n   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.\\n\\n   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion\\n   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.\\n   \\n   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,\\n   you are now able to subscribe to the following:\\n   \\n        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription\\n        ---------                    -------------------------\\n        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca\\n        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca\\n        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca\\n\\tbiz.sco.sources\\t\\t\\t<none>\\n\\tbiz.sco.binaries\\t\\t<none>\\n\\tbiz.sco.magazine\\t     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca\\n\\n   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET\\n   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.

Then they may be able to\\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\\ndon\\'t really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \\n \\nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\\nas no different than anyone else\\'s. But if we could make\\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\\n\"1984.\"   \\n \\nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\\nhasn\\'t stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\\nturns came.\\n \\nNot that I don\\'t think that this gene altering power couldn\\'t wipe us off\\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \\n \\nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don\\'t think\\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\\nmay not. If we don\\'t, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\\npull us through. \\n \\nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\\nthus far, or else haven\\'t had enough power for long enough. \\n \\nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\\ntechnology is really an ancient one.

However, tcpdump did do\\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\\n\\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.

To build tcpview you will\\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\\n\\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \\nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\\n\\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\\tSun4 binaries\\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\\n\\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\\n- easier interface\\n- enhanced protocol decoding\\n- hex display of frame\\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\\n- ethernet address host table\\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\\n\\tprocessing.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\\n\\nNew features:\\n\\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \\nfile type will be automatically detected.\\n\\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\\n\\nThe hex format has been changed.\\n\\nNew time options have been added.\\n\\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\\n\\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\\n\\nNew flags:\\n-R\\tread Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin\\n-ttt\\tprints delta times\\n-tttt\\tprints times relative to the first frame\\n-W\\twrite a Sniffer save file (use with -w)\\n-x\\tprint frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  \\n\\tSample output:\\n\\n16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384\\n        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.\\n        0010  80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00   |  ...d....[.J.....\\n        0020  50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         |  P.@.N.........\\n\\n-X\\tprint TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)\\n-z\\twrite TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)\\n-Z\\twrite frames and TCP data to stdout\\n\\n\\nMartin M.

I\\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\\nBible as God\\'s sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God\\'s\\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\\nof Luther\\'s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\\n\\tBut recently I read Peter Brown\\'s _Body and Society_. It is very\\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today\\'s\\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \\ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\\nviews about other human beings. \\n\\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\\nweird, but we\\'ve got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did\\'nt have to\\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\\nwha does  this say about God\\'s promise to always support the Church.\\nIt\\'s no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\\nnot being an organization at me. It\\'s a community or it is nothing,\\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\\n\\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\\nthis entirely serious issue. I\\'m not sure it is an issue for Protestants\\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\\nChristians are a problem.\\n\\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it\\'s by no\\nmeans the whole story.\\n\\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\\nProtestants don\\'t have quite the same problem you do, because we\\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you\\'ll find Church Fathers such\\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you\\'ll find many\\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don\\'t\\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it\\'s been looked at\\nrecently -- that\\'s the question of whether one can really think of\\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\\nProtestant thought.)\\n\\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there\\'s good\\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there\\'s good reason to\\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can\\'t help\\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\\nsane people that we do now.  I think there\\'s also a certain level of\\n\"revisionism\" active in history at the moment.  I don\\'t mean that\\nthey\\'re manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don\\'t you think\\nthere might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

       "  'From: frank@marvin.contex.com (Frank Perdicaro)\\nSubject: ST1100 ride\\nKeywords: heavy\\nLines: 95\\n\\nSixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \\nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\\n\\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\\na big moto party.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \\nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \\nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\\nbicycle!  \\'It cant be that heavy\\' I thought.\\n\\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \\nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \\ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\\n\\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \\ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \\nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\\n\\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \\nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \\nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\\nbuzz.\\n\\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \\nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \\nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\\n\\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy\\'s wrist, our singal\\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \\nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \\nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \\nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\\n\\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \\nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \\nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\\n\\n\\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I\\'d buy on for about $3000 less than \\nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\\n-- \\n\\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \\t\\t\\t\\tXyvision Color Systems\\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\\t\\t101 Edgewater Drive\\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\\t\\t\\t\\tWakefield MA\\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\\t\\t018801285\\n',\n",

About a week before Germany\\n\\tinvaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from\\n\\tEngland to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular\\n\\treddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to \\n\\texplain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary\\'s\\n\\tprediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.\\n\\n\\tMary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all\\n\\tover the world and persecute religion.  \\n\\n\\tShe said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every\\n\\tsingle one has been realized.  \\tOne can only use the term \"coincidence\"\\n\\tso many times in the same explanation before its use becomes \\n\\tridiculous.  \\n\\n\\tSO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports.

Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last\\nyear, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres\\nhas a \"weak\" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the\\nball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it? Tough. We will simply\\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\\n\\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn\\'t\\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn\\'t fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\\n\\nUnbelievable.\\n\\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\\ngunfire, including 50\\'s tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\\nand firing, you know.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there\\'s a growing feeling that the \\nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \\nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \\nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \\ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \\nsites?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \\nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \\nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three \\nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \\nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \\nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \\ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \\nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \\ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \\nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \\nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \\nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \\nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \\nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \\nthey have troops on the ground there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \\nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \\nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \\nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \\nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \\nthink we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a \\npolicy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \\ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \\ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \\nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \\ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \\nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \\nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \\nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \\ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \\nto stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \\nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \\nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making \\nprogress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and \\nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \\nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \\nthe region.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \\ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \\nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \\nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \\nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the \\nsituation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I \\ndon\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the \\nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \\nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \\nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies \\nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \\nin only a decade.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \\nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \\nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \\nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \\nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \\nThat\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \\neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \\nare moving in the right direction economically.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \\nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \\nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \\nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \\ndidn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \\nThere are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I \\njust disagree with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been \\nunderway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven-\\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \\ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \\nargument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates \\nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \\nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \\nforward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \\nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \\nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \\nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \\njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just \\nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \\ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \\npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \\nbasically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days \\nwith regard to the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Waco --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have \\nmuch to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \\nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \\ninsights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole \\nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \\nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \\nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \\nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry \\nthat they killed their children.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \\nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \\nPerot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people \\nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \\npackage.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign \\nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \\nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \\non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \\nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \\nresubmit them to the Hill?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \\nWe\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going \\nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \\ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \\nthat rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr. \\nPerot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \\nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a \\nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \\nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \\nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if \\nmaybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and \\nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \\npolitical criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you \\nthink you can sit back and just --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \\napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s \\nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \\nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s \\ngot some constructive ideas.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very \\nimpatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one \\nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \\neven if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \\nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \\ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my \\njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \\nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will \\nchange people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \\nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \\ndebate and not just to the President.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \\nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \\ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \\noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \\nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \\nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \\nunilaterally?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \\nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \\nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \\nmandate of the United Nations.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have a mandate and --\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \\nthat we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for \\naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \\nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \\nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \\nWe are not.  \\n\\n\\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \\nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \\nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \\nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \\nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \\nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \\nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \\nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \\nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \\ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \\nwe have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French \\nand others about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would that be military action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \\nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \\nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \\nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \\nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in \\nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \\ngrip?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \\nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s \\nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \\nthese are things you said that you didn\\'t support.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we \\nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \\nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \\nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \\npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \\nqualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \\ndon\\'t know exactly what he said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \\nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \\nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \\nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \\ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \\nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \\nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \\nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss \\nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \\nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going \\nto do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies \\nspeaking out of school.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \\nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s \\na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \\ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \\nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \\nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had \\na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \\nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \\ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a \\nline against an administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \\nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \\nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \\nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \\nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \\nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I \\ndon\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies \\nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \\nwhen you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country \\nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \\ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \\nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \\npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \\nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been \\nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \\ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \\nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \\nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \\npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \\nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \\nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \\nof their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \\nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \\nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \\nof emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \\nand in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to \\nsee it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my \\ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \\nand that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \\nBosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \\ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \\nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \\nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \\nyour decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \\nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \\ndecision?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There \\nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \\nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \\nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \\nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \\nrequired to embark on any new policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \\npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \\naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \\naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \\nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \\nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \\nwar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \\nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \\nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \\nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \\nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \\nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \\nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t \\ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \\nwe couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \\nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \\ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \\nthese wars?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument \\nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \\nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.  \\nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \\nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \\nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \\ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \\npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \\nof ethnic tensions exist.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \\nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \\naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \\nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \\nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \\nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \\nYeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \\nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \\ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the \\nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more \\ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \\nhandle that situation differently now?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that \\nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \\nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come \\nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \\nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \\nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \\nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \\nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \\nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \\nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \\nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \\ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \\nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \\nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \\nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to \\nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \\nhave asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \\nSessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \\nhis future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing \\nbefore you do decide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \\nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \\nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \\nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \\nI\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \\nto do with the direction of the FBI.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \\nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \\nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \\ntake a partisan view in this war?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \\nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \\ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \\na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \\nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \\nbe successful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \\nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \\npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \\nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \\nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \\nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \\neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \\ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \\nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \\nlooking at what else we can do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \\nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \\nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \\nAren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \\nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \\nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \\nGermany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so --\\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve \\ngot all of our options under review.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \\nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \\nmilitary operation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.  \\nThat\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \\nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \\ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \\nde facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.  \\nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \\nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \\npower.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \\ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re \\ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that \\nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \\nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \\nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \\nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \\nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of \\nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \\nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \\nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \\nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \\nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \\nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \\na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \\nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \\ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \\ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \\nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \\nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \\nrefinance their debt.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \\ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \\nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \\nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \\nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \\nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \\ntough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.  \\nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the \\ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \\nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \\ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \\nof this country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \\nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \\nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \\nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \\nmillions of Americans.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \\nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \\nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \\nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \\nSo I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.  \\nI feel good about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that \\none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \\npractically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own \\ncountry, how can we do it for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \\nIt\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be \\nfair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \\naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \\nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \\nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \\ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \\nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \\naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \\nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \\nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \\nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \\nbe tied by many members of Congress.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \\ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \\nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \\nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \\nThe Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and \\nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \\nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \\nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \\nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \\nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \\nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \\nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \\npursued.  \\n\\n\\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \\nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \\nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \\nwill do that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \\nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \\nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \\nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \\nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \\norder to then build support for Russian aid?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \\nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \\nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \\nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \\ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \\ntoward reform.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \\nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \\nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \\nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \\nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \\neconomy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And \\nin a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all \\nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \\nbecause they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so \\nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \\nthat\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \\npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \\nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \\ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \\nthink that we should support that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \\nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \\nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready \\nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \\nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \\nagreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental \\nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \\nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \\nposition, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty \\nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \\nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an \\nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \\nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \\nviolating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an \\napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \\nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \\nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out \\nthe details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \\nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \\nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \\nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \\nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \\ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only \\nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \\nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \\nregion, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \\nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot \\nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \\none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \\nknow, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for \\nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \\nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong \\nabout the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not \\nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \\nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \\nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \\nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \\nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \\ndetails needed to be improved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \\ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \\nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \\nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \\nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \\nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \\nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \\nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \\nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \\nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \\nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \\nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \\nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \\nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \\nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \\nevaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \\nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \\nthink that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \\nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \\ninterchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know \\nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t \\nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I \\nwas encouraged by the last trip.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \\nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \\npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \\nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \\nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \\nus to confirm good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \\nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases \\nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \\nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \\nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \\nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \\nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \\ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \\nthose cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \\nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \\ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \\nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \\nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \\nvery influenced by how the families feel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \\nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \\nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \\nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \\ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \\nDole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \\nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \\nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \\nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \\nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \\nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \\nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \\nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \\nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \\nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \\nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \\npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \\nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \\nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \\na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \\nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \\nPresident, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all \\nstrung out and we\\'re divided.\"  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \\nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \\nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \\nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \\nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \\nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \\nhundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could \\nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \\nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \\nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \\nBut the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water --\\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and redo --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \\nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \\npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \\nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \\nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \\njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \\nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \\nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \\nwe need more police officers on the street.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once \\nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \\njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \\nstreet who\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \\npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \\nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \\nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s \\nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \\nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \\nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \\nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \\nright to know the names of the senior officers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \\nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \\nan Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I \\nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \\nmight be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think \\nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \\nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I \\nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \\nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \\nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \\nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \\nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \\ncon.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing \\nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \\non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \\nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \\nforces, sir?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \\nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \\ninto a ground war there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our \\nevaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never \\nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \\nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \\nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \\nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \\nparticipating in some of the activities? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t \\nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \\nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \\nbe done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of \\nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \\nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \\nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \\nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \\nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \\nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \\ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \\nAnd that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \\nbe here, but for others as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.\\n\\n                                 END1:48 P.M.

Many of the apocryphal books are highly\\n\"dynamic\" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.\\n\\n: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\\n\\nBy whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\\ncollected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\\nin the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\\n\\n: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\\n\\nThis is demonstrably false.\\n\\n: To quote Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\\n: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\\n: anachronisms.\\n\\nSo do other books of the Bible.\\n\\n: 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\n: which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n\\n\"False\" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no\\ncontradiction with the rest of scripture.  \\n\\n: 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\n: subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n\\nThis is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate\\nthe same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.\\n(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal \"Additions to the Book of\\nEsther\" act rather to bring the \"unscripturelike\" book of Esther more into\\nline with other books.)\\n\\n: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\n: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\n: poetic and religious feeling.\\n\\nHave you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They\\nexhibit every bit as much \"poetic and religious feeling\" as Psalms or\\nProverbs.\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n: How do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\\n: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\\n: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\n: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\\n: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\\n: holy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\\n: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\\n\\nThese words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,\\nnot to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very\\nlate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary\\nrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.\\n\\n: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus\\' attitude. He had no\\n: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\\n: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \\n: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \\n: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\\n: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\\n: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\\n\\nJesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,\\nthe canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books\\nof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of\\nthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.\\nThe Torah (Pentateuch/ \"Law\") was established in Jesus\\' day, as were\\nthe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,\\nwere still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the\\nPsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all\\npart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.\\n\\nTo argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51\\nis weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological\\nstory.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the\\npresent order) did not exist as such in Jesus\\' day.\\n\\nrevdak@netcom.com\\n',\n",

Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\\n\\n\\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\\n\\n\\tAlso: \\n\\n\\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \\n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\\n\\n\\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \\nnon-PostScript printers.\\n\\n\\tSome vendors\\' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \\ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \\ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \\nhave a \\'screendump\\' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \\nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\\n\\n\\tSome vendors\\' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \\nsupport for printing xwd files, but you\\'ll typically need some other package \\nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\\n\\n\\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \\n\\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \\nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \\n\\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \\ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\\n\\n\\tThis can\\'t be done unless the X server has been extended.

It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \\ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\\n\\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center\\'s IMtools (\\'imconv\\' in \\nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\\nIt\\'s available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\\n\\n\\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost\\'s xloadimage, a\\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \\nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \\nGraeme Gill\\'s updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \\nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\\n\\n\\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \\ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \\nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \\ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \\nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \\nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \\nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n\\n\\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \\nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\\n\\n\\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\\n\\n\\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \\nto PBMPLUS.

There is \\na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \\nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \\nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\\n\\n\\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \\nexport\\'s contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\\n\\n\\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\\nas part of Sam Leffler\\'s libtiff package and it is also available on\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x.

If you give \\na resource specification like this:\\n\\t\\txterm*geometry: 80x24\\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\\n80x24.

This command can be placed in a \\nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\\n\\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\\nadapted to do this.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\\n\\n\\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \\nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \\napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\n\\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open Windows, and you also \\nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \\nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \\napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \\nXtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\\n                application\\'s class name.\\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n        %t      The territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n        %c      The codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is \\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \\nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\n\\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \\nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \\nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set \\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \\ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n\\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \\nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \\nMyterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so you can run the application\\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\\n%S are useless.\\n\\n\\tWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization \\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\n\\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \\ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\n\\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n\\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\\nthis batch of default settings.)\\n\\n\\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n\\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory \\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \\nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\n\\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \\nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \\ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \\nby a slash.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\\n\\nThe answer lies in changing xdm\\'s xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \\nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \\n\\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \\nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \\n\\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\\n\\t#!/bin/sh\\n\\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \\npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\\n\\t\\teval `xrlogind`\\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \\nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \\nrecreate the environment variables.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \\nthe path.)\\n\\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\\n\\t\\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\\n\\t\\t\\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\\n\\t\\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\\n\\n\\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\\n\\n-- Is the font directory you\\'re specifying readable from the SERVER\\'s file\\n   system?  Remember, it\\'s the server, not the client, which interprets your\\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\\n\\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you\\'re running an MIT server\\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can\\'t find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you\\'re\\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".

[2/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\\n\\n\\tder Mouse\\'s getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \\nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \\nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \\nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \\nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \\nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\\n\\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font that\\nthe R5 server has access to.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\\n\\n\\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don\\'t exist on a non-DEC installation,\\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \\ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \\nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \\ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \\nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\\n\\n\\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC\\'s X server is the \".pcf\" format.\\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC\\'s dxfc\\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\\nperformance hit.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\\nI want to be able to do something like this:\\n\\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\\n\\n\\tYou can\\'t do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \\nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \\nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \\nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \\nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \\nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \\nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \\nuse in many of its widgets, however.\\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\\n\\nHowever:\\n\\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \\nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \\n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \\nimage formats as a pixmap.\\n\\n\\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \\nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \\ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \\nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information\\non the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is\\navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on \\nthe R5 contrib tape.

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \\n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \\n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \\n: favorite.\\n\\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\\nChicago produced this table:\\n\\n\\t\\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\\n\\t\\t\\t    Resulting in Death\\n\\t\\t\\t    \\n\\tWeapon\\t\\t\\t\\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\\n\\t---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\\t\\t 2.4\\n\\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\\t\\t12.2\\n\\n\\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\\n\\t\\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \\n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \\nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \\nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \\nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.

It's called RADAR.\\nWell, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500\\nfeet altitude.\\n\\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\\n\\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\\nshould know about anyway ;-).\\n\\n>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\\n>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\\n>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\\n\\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\\n\\n>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in\\n>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this\\n>concept.\\n\\nNope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless\\nthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.\\nThis is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.\\nSignals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...\\n\\n>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?\\n\\nAs high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance\\nattenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies\\naround 4 GHz.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\n\\n-- \\n==========================================================\\nJack Brindle\\nham radio: wa4fib\\ninternet: jackb@mdd.comm.mot.com\\n\",\n",

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\\n\\nMicrostation Imager\\n-------------------\\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

In addition, people often request information which has\\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\\ntitles:\\n\\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\\n\\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\\nothers are entirely optional.\\n\\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.  Questions\\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\\n\\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding\\nStuff\" section below.\\n\\n\\n                                   Credits\\n\\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the\\nauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it\\ndoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating\\naround the network.\\n\\n\\n                                Finding Stuff\\n\\nAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are\\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can\\'t find them:\\n\\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\\n\\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].\\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\\'ll find the latest\\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\\n\\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\\n\\n   in the body.\\n\\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5. If you don\\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\\n   consisting of the following lines:\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\\n\\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\\n   the following lines:\\n\\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\\n\\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\\n   There\\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\\n   \"send atheism/index\".\\n\\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\\'t have \\n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\nÿ\\n',\n",

So what distinguishes, for example, the\\n>Branch Davidian \"cult\" from the Presbyterian \"church\"?  Doctrinal\\n>differences don\\'t answer the question, IMHO, so don\\'t use them as\\n>an answer.\\n\\n\\nAs far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and\\nChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself\\nin the feet of one of Jesus\\'s disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\\nJesus.\\n\\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\\nDavid Koresh was not.\\n\\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \\nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\\nwould be followed.  But since judges don\\'t always get it right,\\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\\n\\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \\na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\\npeople to do bad things. \\n\\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\\n\\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\\nsay is that we shouldn\\'t be looking for principles that tell us\\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the\\nbegotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and\\nnobody else was.\\n\\nStephen\\n',\n",

Since,  however, I agree with those who  \\nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \\nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \\nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \\npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \\npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \\nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \\nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \\nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \\ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \\ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \\nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \\nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \\nBank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  \\nleftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  \\ngoing to propose giving up Jerusalem.

The trap is the easy way out.\\n\\tFor yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You\\'re\\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\\n\\tIf, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you\\'d see the crime\\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\\ndefine \"us\" and \"other\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\\nhumans.\\n\\tIt\\'s interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don\\'t know the racial\\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can\\'t speak to your situation. However, I live in\\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \"ethnic diversity\". Here, we\\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \"model minority\") gangs,\\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\\nthe street and they\\'ll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\\ncrime are what they most fear. During the \"disturbance\" in Los Angeles last\\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country\\'s first truly\\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\\nriot!\\n\\tIn closing, I\\'d like to say that you raise some interesting points\\nthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the\\nracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As\\na people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem\\nbecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly\\nbelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current\\ncourse of denial and repression.\\n\\tI wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,\\nluck in avoiding the \"trap\". \\n\\tPeace, my brother.\\n\\t\\t\\tm.\\n-- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHokh\\'Ton\\t:\\tThe Crystal Wind is the Storm,\\n  mdouglas@netcom.com\\t:\\t and the Storm is Data,\\nMichael Douglas-Llyr\\t:\\t  and the Data is Life.\\n\\t\\t\\t:\\t\\t---Player\\'s Litany (The Long Run)\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",

In the \\nmid-late 80\\'s, MS\\'s point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over\\nthe world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS\\n(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.\\nThe theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people\\nuntil they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the \\nwayside.\\n\\nThen Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to\\nbe doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either\\nstayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that\\npoint in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the\\nshort term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS\\n3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS\\'s refocussing on DOS and Windows.\\nVersion 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will\\noffer even more in terms of \"real\" OS features (I work on NT and have no\\nreal clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do\\nknow that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a\\nfew years ago).\\n\\n\\t...Dave\\n\\nOf course these are my opinions.

The second part is \\n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\\n  sections of this document  before posting. \\n  \\n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \\n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \\n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \\n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \\n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \\n\\n    \\n\\n ==================== \\n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\\n ====================\\n  \\n       Congratulations!  You\\'ve come to the right place.  Usenet is \\n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \\n  P.S.  I\\'m running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \\n  \\n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\\n  and it\\'s developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\\n  news.announce.newusers.\\n\\n\\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \\n     \\n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\\n  a general introduction which you\\'re reading now, and specific lists\\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\\n  stored compressed so you\\'ll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \\n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\\n  before sending it to you. \\n  \\n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\\n  else in the FAQ even if you don\\'t have the other parts at hand. \\n  It\\'s not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\\n  where. \\n  \\n         To jump to a particular question search for\\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\\n  use a zero for  the question number.\\n\\n\\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\\n\\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \\n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It\\'s posted to that group weekly and \\n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \\n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \\n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you\\'re reading now\\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\\n  conversion and printing.  It\\'s available in comp.fonts or by ftp\\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple\\'s UNIX\\n  environment, A/UX.  It\\'s posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\\n  and news.answers. It\\'s available for anonymous ftp at\\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\\n\\n\\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\\n  \\n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \\n  You wouldn\\'t ask your English teacher how to do the definite\\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don\\'t ask\\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\\n  ways of  communicating.  \\n  \\n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\\n  network software designers.\\n  \\n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \\n  If a question isn\\'t important enough for you to take the extra\\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it\\'s not important\\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \\n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\\n  catch-all newsgroup.\\n  \\n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \\n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\\n  \\n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \\n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \\n  \\n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\\n  delve into the how\\'s of a program as well as the what\\'s (Recent\\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\\n    \\n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\\n  understand that you\\'re desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How \\'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\\n  \\n         Finally don\\'t be so provincial as to consider only the\\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \\n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it\\'s not a\\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet\\'s a big place\\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\\n  comp.sys.mac.\\n\\n\\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN\\'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\\n\\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\\n  for answering common questions like this one.\\n   \\n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\\n  lets me send PWFAQ\\'s (people with frequently asked questions) the\\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\\n  click of a button so please don\\'t feel obligated to respond to\\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\\n  can\\'t be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\\n\\n    \\n\\n === \\n FTP  (2.0) \\n ===\\n\\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\\n\\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\\n  should be available at the above sites.\\n  \\n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \\n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \\n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \\n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \\n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \\n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\n  (130.69.254.254). \\n\\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \\n  This is Apple\\'s semi-official repository for system software,\\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\\n  that come more or less straight from Apple\\'s mouth.  Some material\\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\\n  sites that don\\'t have an official license to distribute Apple\\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you\\'re\\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\\n  material you find here.\\n\\n\\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\\n\\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \\n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\\n\\n\\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\\n\\n      If you can\\'t find what you\\'re looking for at one of the above\\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \\n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\\n  you\\'re looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \\n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\\n  the name.  For instance if you didn\\'t find Disinfectant with \"prog\\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\\n  \"prog disi.*\\\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \\n\\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\\n\\n\\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\\n\\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\\n\\n\\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\\n\\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they\\'re\\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they\\'re\\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\\n  protocol.\\n  \\n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\\n  you\\'ve FTP\\'d and downloaded to your Mac you\\'ll need to reverse the\\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\\n  files as they are downloaded.\\n\\n***************************************************************************\\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \\nExtractors\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \\nCompact Pro|         X     X \\nPackit     |                           X\\nUUTool     |                                                      X \\nMacCompress|                                X \\nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \\nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \\nBinHex 4.0 |               X \\nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \\nUnZip      |                                                   X \\nDiskCopy   |                                     X \\nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\\n***************************************************************************\\n\\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\\n\\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \\n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\\n  Expander. \\n    \\n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\\n   \\n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\\n  products, so use them instead when that\\'s an  option.  Translators\\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\\n  available by anonymous ftp. \\n  \\n         Macutil is dik winter\\'s package of UNIX utilities to\\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\\n  automatically converted on download.  It can\\'t decompress\\n  everything. In particular it can\\'t decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\\n  info-mac/unix directory.\\n\\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\\n\\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \\n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\\n  they\\'ll be downloading MacBinary files.\\n  \\n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\\n  Christensen\\'s freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \\n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\\n  \\n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don\\'t merit a position in the above\\n  table because they\\'re self-extracting.  They may have been created\\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \\n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \\n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\\n\\n\\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\\n\\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you\\'re at a\\n  university there\\'s absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\\n  give you a copy; and if you\\'re anywhere less remote than McMurdo\\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \\n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don\\'t need BinHex.\\n    \\n         If you\\'re such a computer geek that the thought of actually\\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \\n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \\n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \\n  \\n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \\n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I\\'ll mention that \\n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \\n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \\n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\\n  it\\'s always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\\n  fails look for something similar.  If you\\'ve ftp\\'d straight onto\\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\\n  you\\'ve ftp\\'d to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\\n  \\n  \\n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\\n\\n       You can\\'t.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \\n  terrify those among you who haven\\'t left your parents\\' basement \\n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you\\'re going \\n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \\n  (though I suppose if you\\'re this much of  a nerd you could send \\n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you\\'re gathering\\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \\n  of daylight, please don\\'t bother the net by asking this question\\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \\n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\\n\\n\\n\\n=================================================================\\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\\n================================================================= \\n\\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren\\'t covered here. \\n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\\n  recommend solutions to you.\\n\\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\\n\\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn\\'t say much.  What were you\\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \\n  The more precisely you\\'ve identified the problem and the actions\\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\\n  problem and see if it\\'s still there or not.\\n\\n\\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\\n\\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren\\'t documented in the\\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\\n  familiar.\\n\\n\\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\\n\\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \\n   \\n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\\n  on a disk may not contain the data it\\'s supposed to contain.  This\\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \\n\\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \\n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\\n  reinstall. \\n  \\n         If the problem continues to occur after you\\'ve taken these\\n  steps, chances are you\\'ve found either a conflict between your\\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\\n  program.  So it\\'s time to\\n\\n\\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \\n \\n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\\n  cause of a system or application crash:\\n  \\n     a.\\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \\n     the crash.\\n     \\n     b.\\tIf you\\'re running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you\\'re\\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \\n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \\n     when performing complicated operations.\\n     \\n     c. If you\\'re running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\\n     addressing.  There\\'s still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\\n     software out there including some from companies that really \\n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \\n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \\n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\\n     \\n     d.\\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you\\'ve narrowed the\\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you\\'ve found the\\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \\n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\\n\\n\\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\\n\\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\\n  software, call it.  If you\\'re lucky the company will have a work\\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they\\'ll at least add the\\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\\n\\n    \\n\\n ====================== \\n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\\n ======================\\n\\n      You wouldn\\'t drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who\\'ll be happy to\\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there\\'s\\n  no reason you can\\'t change it yourself.  The following nine-step\\n  program should be performed about every three months. \\n\\n\\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\\n\\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you\\'re at all like me,\\n  you\\'ll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you\\'ve\\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn\\'t like, announcements\\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\\n  longer need.  If you\\'re running System 7 you may also have several\\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \\n  the trash.\\n\\n\\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\\n\\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \\n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \\n  in your collection.  If you don\\'t use the functionality of an\\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you\\'re probably\\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \\n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there\\'s no\\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \\n\\n\\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\\n\\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \\n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \\n  Every so often it\\'s necessary to throw the bums out and start with\\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it\\'s easier to rebuild the desktop than\\n  to defeat an incumbent. \\n  \\n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\\n  you\\'ve stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\\n  Volaski\\'s freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \\n  if Apple\\'s Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \\n  \\n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \\n  You\\'ll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \\n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\\n  have the longer it will take.  If you\\'re running System 6 you may\\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\\n   \\n          If you\\'re experiencing definite problems and not just doing\\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation\\'s\\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\\n  corrupt data structures.    \\n\\n\\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\\n\\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\\n  RAM.  Since you\\'ve erased almost all the settings in the General\\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\\n   \\n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \\n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\\n  notoriously inaccurate you\\'ll probably want to take this\\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\\n\\n\\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \\n\\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn\\'t big enough\\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\\n  \\n         If you\\'re using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you\\'re running System 6\\n  it\\'s important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \\n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg\\'s freeware utility\\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\\n  needs to be allocated.  If you\\'re running System 6, get BootMan,\\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\\n\\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\\n  you\\'ve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \\n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here\\'s how:\\n\\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \\n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \\n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \\n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \\n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \\n        replaced in the new installation.  If you\\'re running or \\n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \\n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \\n        of the System Folder.\\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \\n        is  fine.\\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \\n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \\n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \\n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don\\'t \\n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \\n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \\n        folder.  If you\\'re asked if you want to replace anything, you \\n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You\\'ll need to replace \\n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \\n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA\\'s you removed in step 2.\\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \\n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \\n        system overall.\\n\\n\\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\\n\\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\\n  disks. It\\'s also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \\n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\\n     \\n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\\n  work are Central Point\\'s MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation\\'s\\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec\\'s Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \\n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\\n   \\n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\\n  can\\'t fix.  When that happens it\\'s time to backup (4.7) and\\n  reformat (4.9).\\n\\n\\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\\n\\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\\n  from your application and support files then it\\'s easy to only back\\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \\n  \\n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\\n  \\n         Finally if you\\'re lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\\n  doesn\\'t support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\\n  Backup from System 6.  \\n\\n\\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\\n\\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\\n  \\n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\\n  you\\'re at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\\n   \\n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\\n  about their safety, once you\\'ve bought the software and opened the\\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don\\'t annoy the\\n  net by asking for one. \\n\\n\\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\\n\\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don\\'t\\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there\\'s no reason at all not\\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple\\'s left on your disk.\\n     \\n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \\n  Apple\\'s disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \\n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\\n  your hard disk.\\n  \\n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\\n  bundled with your hard disk. \\n  \\n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\\n  data losses are a very good possibility.\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Elliotte Rusty Harold         Department of Mathematics\\n  elharo@shiva.njit.edu         New Jersey Institute of Technology\\n  erh0362@tesla.njit.edu        Newark, NJ 07102\\n\\n',\n",

(Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection\\nif you\\'re going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular\\nbasis or have been threatened.)\\n\\n>The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or\\n>records of SERIOUS mental diseases.\\n\\n       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among\\ngun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\\ncontain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\\nif you qualify in every way.\\n\\n>Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun\\n>-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.\\n>It\\'s a little like getting a drivers licence isn\\'t it ???\\n>You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\\n\\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\\na driver\\'s licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it\\'s a joke. \\n\\n       But my usual objection is that you\\'re discussing two different\\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver\\'s license is a permit\\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\\nfrom the government\\'s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\\npast legally, since it wouldn\\'t be based on making regulations on public\\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \\n\\n>Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):\\n>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners \\'arms\\'\\n>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\\n>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \\n>time befor the crime.\\n>\\n>Use of knives:\\n>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or \\'open\\'.\\n>You (Americans) think it\\'s ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\\n>in public -rigth ??\\n\\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\\nas from one country in Europe to another).\\n\\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \\n\\n>Individual vs masses:\\n>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\\n>extent....\\n>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\\n>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \\n>all the others ??\\n\\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \\nthe rights of some other group.  \\n\\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you\\'d\\nhave a point.  But essentially what we\\'re discussing is that becuase\\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else\\'s\\nrights.  It\\'s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\\nby one.\\n\\n>The issue:\\n>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\\n\\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\\n\\n>We shouldn\\'t mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\\n>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\\n>But should it have to be like that ??\\n\\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn\\'t have to fear that\\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\\nBut currently we don\\'t have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\\n\\n>Do you think it\\'s wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\\n\\n       No state does.  In any case, there\\'s a limit to which the state\\nmay enforce it\\'s \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\\n   \\n>If you believe it\\'s smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\\n>it should be free to buy guns ??\\n\\n       I\\'ll raise my hand against driver\\'s licenses.

       "  \"From: prz@sage.cgd.ucar.edu (Philip Zimmermann)\\nSubject: Fighting the Clipper Initiative\\nSummary: Ways to fight it \\nOrganization: Climate and Global Dynamics Division/NCAR, Boulder, CO\\nLines: 71\\n\\nHere are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White\\nHouse Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a\\ntough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of\\nresources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are\\nserious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate\\nBill 266 in 1991.\\n\\nPossible actions to take in response:\\n\\n1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and\\nmore.\\n\\n2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and\\ntechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,\\nwrite some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or\\nnewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. \\nRemember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be\\nslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and\\narcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming\\nlibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. \\n\\n3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your\\nMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US\\nSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of\\ntechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.\\n\\n4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party\\nwould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of\\nthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a\\nsurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political\\nspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other\\nactivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government\\nthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play\\nthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you\\nwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.\\n\\n4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and\\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming\\nthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal\\nexpenses and lobbying.\\n\\n5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably\\ndevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be\\nlobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a\\ntelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your\\ncoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then\\npresent your company's management with a united front of engineering\\ntalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your\\nmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold\\nmeetings on it.\\n\\n6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla\\ntechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,\\nanonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,\\netc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might\\nalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed\\nby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful\\ntools for these purposes. \\n\\n7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on\\nthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we\\nmay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't\\noutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of\\nthis Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to\\nanalyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it\\nmodified.\\n\\n\\n-Philip Zimmermann\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the\\ngovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the government\\nshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the\\nConstitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT\\ndo.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the\\nstates and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the\\nBill of Rights talk about).\\n\\nSince I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am\\nappending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and\\nyou, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.\\nIf that isn\\'t enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the\\nJudiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are\\nsome things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have\\nreally had to swallow hard to admit.\\n\\nI think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution\\nand state what it means will say the same thing.

Neil Schulman\\n\\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you\\'d ring up Carl Sagan,\\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n\\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n\\nA little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\nexpertise.\\n\\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n\\nHe\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\nWebster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\nof the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n\\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\\n\\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n\\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\nsentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\nfree State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\noath to support, if necessary.\"\\n\\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\nthen concluded:\\n\\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n\\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n\\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\nmaintaining a militia.\\n\\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\nand bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\nto a right of the people.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\nthat such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\nexisting, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\nshall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\nconditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\nmilitia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\nmilitia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n\\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\nauthority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\ncontrol over the military.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\nAmendment to the following sentence,\\n\\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\ninfringed.\\'\\n\\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n\\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\nand\\n\\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\nto keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\namendment in grammatical structure.\\n\\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n\\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\nany conclusion.\"\\n\\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\nprotects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n\\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\nold guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n\\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n\\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn\\'t mean what it says it means but\\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\\n\\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\\n\\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\\ncredited.

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  \\ntrying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \\nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \\nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \\nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\\n\\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\\n\\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\\nEurope\\'s workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\\nJewish state.\\n\\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the \\'Jewish\\nproblem\\'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\\nbe considered by German Jews.\\n\\nThe best example of this was the \\'Transfer Agreement\\' of 1934.\\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\\nout, the campaign would collapse.\\n\\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\\nrace, nation, and the nature of the \\'Jewish problem\\', and it\\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\\n\\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\\n\\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany\\'s Jews out of\\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\\n\\'helping\\' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\\nJews come and agree with them.\\n\\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the \\'new\\nJew\\' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\\n\\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\\n\\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen\\'s play\\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\\n\\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner\\'s\\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary\\'s Jews to\\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\\nconditions were met.\\n\\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\\nwork camps.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\\ndestruction: the trains of \\'prominents\\' which Eichmann promised to\\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\\nJews.\\n\\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\\n\\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\\nJews.\\n\\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\\nbe it.\\n\\n',\n",

Such \"extra-\\n>rational\" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\\n\\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\\nand _method_.

No theoretical argument should be\\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\\n\\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\\nlarge part of the history of science.\\n\\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\\n\\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\\n\\n(I wouldn\\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\\nI don\\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\\n\\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\\nfunction of science: results don\\'t count unless they can be replicated.\\n\\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\\n\\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\\'s irrational motivation had\\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\\n\\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\\nthink supports their position (creationists).\\n-- \\nMark A.

They believe they\\'re going to _die_. Understand\\nthat you\\'ve turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\\nthat all animals are \\'going to Hell.\\' Are you sure this is what you want\\nto say? (presumably animals don\\'t have the opportunity to get to heaven,\\nbut this still doesn\\'t change the fact that they\\'re going to Hell (die\\na final death))\\n\\n   I don\\'t claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \\n(assuming I \\'go to Hell\\' and not to Heaven) In other words, I\\'ll\\nnever know I\\'m dead. Hmmm... \\n\\n\\n>  Hell doesn\\'t have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it\\'s eternal,\\n\\n    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:\\n \"At least she\\'s not suffering any more; She\\'s in Heaven now.\" ?\\n\\n    Consider the following statement:\\n \"At least she\\'s not suffering any more; She\\'s in Hell now.\"\\n\\n    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, \\nit would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. \\nGranted, they wouldn\\'t be *anything* (wouldn\\'t be having any\\nconscious experience whatsoever). \\n\\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \\nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \\nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \\n\\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\\nIt\\'s my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\\nsuper-survival. \\n\\n \\n>and it\\'s a lot worse than Heaven.  That\\'s the only comparison that matters.\\n\\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \\nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \\n\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\" asked an\\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\\nto the effect of, \"Well what good is your Heaven if there\\'s no hunting?\\nScram.\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \\nimmortality). \\n\\n\\n>Alan Terlep\\t\\t\\t\\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\\n>Oakland University, Rochester, MI\\t\\t\\t\\n>atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\\t\\t\\t\\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\\n>Rushing in where angels fear to tread.\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n   Pax,\\n\\n    Dana\\n',\n",

When an\\ninfant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither\\ninnocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is\\nbaptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a\\nnew life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians\\n2:5).

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 117\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

(Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\\n\\n  The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around\\nby the sun\\'s ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins.

No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \\nlife\\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \\nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \\neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \\ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \\nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\\'m curios to see what \\nthey did and ate. Don\\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \\ndon\\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \\nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \\ndid the household concept \\'immortal\\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \\nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \\ndie)\\n\\n  Warning about writing to the past:\\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \\nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \\nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \\nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \\nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\n\\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\nthey aren\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\n\\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\n\\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \\ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \\nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\\'ll \\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\\'s cornered, and then he\\'ll \\nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\\'re willing to \\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\nright, and he didn\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\'t need to go \\nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \\nyour destiny, just don\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \\nin which you don\\'t want to be a part of. \\n\\n  I don\\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \\nthat the others could have been \\'pruned\\' from our path. Maybe these \\nthoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.\\n\\n  \\n \\n',\n",

I know\\n>that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\\n>hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying\\' You fools,\\n>do you still think that just believing is enough?\\'\\n\\nActually I don\\'t think there is any conflict if we really understand\\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \\nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \\nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \\nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \\nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \\nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \\nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \\nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \\nlater and wouldn\\'t understand the meaning of the original Greek.\\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\\nthe Greek.\\n\\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul\\'s\\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\\nburden of Paul\\'s life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\\nwriters intended.\\n\\n>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\\n>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\\n\\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\\n\\n>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\\n>him (i.e. doesn\\'t know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\\n>knows and believes in God but doesn\\'t make any attempt to live by the bible.\\n\\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \\nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \\nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\\n\\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that\\'s not what you meant.\\n\\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I\\'d\\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\\nJesus calls being born again.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,\\nand therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when\\nacessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I \\nimagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,\\nand sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.

There should be no following of personalities in the church\\n(and in time, their writings)\\n   C.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \\n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\\n     be to know God.\\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\\n\\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\\n         6:3.\\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\\n         unlimited power over all creation).\\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\\n         regarding salvation.\\n\\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  In creation\\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\\n          Heb. 1:3.\\n     B.  In salvation\\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \\n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\\n         active in salvation.\\n         1.  God, the Father\\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\\n             important works:\\n             a.

He came to provide salvation for all whom the\\n                  Father had chosen.

The\\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\\n         3.

He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \\n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \\n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\\n             i.

Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I\\nwould like to automate the procedure.\\n\\nThe problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the\\nobvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to\\nXV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images\\nare in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image\\ncolors for the dither.

A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they\\'re afraid\\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\\nmugger...the rapist. \\n\\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\\nalways, there\\'s the implied question \"what\\'s a pretty little thing like\\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\\n\\nBut what if you don\\'t like dogs? Like living alone? Don\\'t have 10\\nyears to devote learning judo?\\n\\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \\n\\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\\nwhole community.\\n\\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\\nhelp themselves?\\n\\nHere\\'s a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\\n\"Eughh, how could you? I\\'d be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\\nhurt someone? They\\'ll repeat the lie: it\\'ll just get taken away from\\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\\n\\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\\nmade that hard choice. We\\'ve decided that we are not going to be\\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We\\'re buying more\\nguns than every before. We\\'re learning how to use them - and teaching\\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\\nWe\\'re taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We\\'re\\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\\n\\nBut there\\'s another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\\n\\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\\npeople. It\\'s the way they survive.\\n\\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it\\'ll do next -\\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\\n\"it\\'s for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\\n\\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \\n\\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn\\'t crazy if someone\\'s\\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they\\'re after you and they\\'re\\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we\\'re lucky, they\\'ll settle for\\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \\n\\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \\n\\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \\n\\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\\n\\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government\\'s ways. I will\\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \\n\\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick. \\n\\nMy opinions are, of course, my own.\\n\\n',\n",

Are you suggesting that he\\n    has stated what is Israel\\'s policy today?  Have you ever seen\\n    Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone  \\n    actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?

Begin is dead.  And it\\n    should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,\\n    it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it\\n    captured them.

Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \\n\\n\\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \\nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \\n\\n\\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \\nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \\nan explanatory method?  \\n\\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \\n\\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\\n\\n\\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \\n\\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\\n\\n\\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \\n\\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \\n\\t   the NCI.\\n\\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \\nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \\nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don\\'t think that using anti-fungal \\nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \\nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \\ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \\nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \\nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \\nhealer\\'s oath, \"I will do no harm\".  But you know David that very few \\ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \\nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \\nphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some \\nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \\napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \\nas the motive is improving the patient\\'s health and not an attempt to rake \\nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \\nthe medicare fraud cases), I don\\'t see the need to label these healers as \\nquacks or even unethical.\\n\\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \\nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \\nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \\nreally doing a pretty good job of providing \"alternative\" medicine.  But \\nmany lack any formal training and are in the \"business\" simply to make a \\nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \\ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \\ncare area is really a buyer\\'s beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \\nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \\nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \\nliscened physicians).\\n\\nI hope that this clears things up David.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

The church, for example,\\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\\natoms\". \\n\\nPHILIP K. DICK\\n\\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.

Examines the way in which\\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \\n316 pages.

ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\\n\\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\\n\\n\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \"The Coherence of\\nTheism\" (1977) and was concluded with \"Faith and Reason\" (1981).  In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

The passenger\\nseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren\\'t\\neven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my\\nback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the\\nreasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had\\na BMW. :)\\n\\nI\\'d suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains\\nor some such.  Then see how much pain she\\'s in, and proceed from there.\\n\\nThe best advice I\\'d give a beginning passenger:\\n\\n- Don\\'t get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort\\n  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on \\n  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I\\'m ready, and at the stop\\n  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.\\n\\n- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don\\'t wiggle (unless your rider\\n  asks you to :)\\n\\n- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements\\n  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,\\n  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.\\n\\n- Get used to your rider\\'s shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably\\n  consistent shifting style).  Avoid \"helmet bonk.\"  Helmet bonk is \\n  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change\\n  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It\\n  gets old real fast.\\n\\n- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep\\n  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands\\n  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you\\'re in pain,\\n  but I\\'m told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.\\n\\n- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be \\n  sure and squeeze your thighs while you\\'re doing it so your rider knows you\\'re\\n  still there. :)  The guard rail isn\\'t as safe as holding onto your rider.\\n\\n- Don\\'t be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you\\'re in pain or\\n  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed \\n  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*********************************************************\\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\\n*********************************************************\\n\\n',\n",

I came \\nhome from school at 12 o\\'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \\nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \\nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \\nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \\ncousin\\'s birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \\non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \\nthat I\\'d have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\\n\\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \\nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \\nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \\nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \\npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \\ntaken for Armenians.\\n\\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \\nbuilding where we knew there\\'d be a place to hide, but the whole road was \\npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \\nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people\\'s pockets and checking\\npassports. People who didn\\'t have passports with them were beaten as well.\\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\\n\\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn\\'t turn on any lights. We tried to call \\nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \\nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \\ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \\nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \\nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors\\' daughter said that that\\'s right, \\nthat\\'s what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \\nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn\\'t stay very \\nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \\nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \\nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \\nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . .

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \\nthinks I\\'ve misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \\nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \\nways and I correct the situation.

If your\\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don\\'t even have to look at the\\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).

Of course with non-polarized connectors\\nthis doesn\\'t matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\\nwhich side is pin 1.\\n\\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \\ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400.

Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

Ideally, these questions could be\\nasked at any investigation into the BATF\\'s and FBI\\'s participation\\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \\nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \\n\\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\\n     the BATF obtained?\\n\\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \\n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \\n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \\n     on the door of the Branch Davidian\\'s complex and serve the warrant \\n     in a manner prescribed by law?\\n\\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\\n     Knowing children were present, why didn\\'t the BATF have an\\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \\n\\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\\n     dispossessed weapons.\\n\\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent\\'s\\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \\n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\\n\\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\\n     situation? \\n\\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \\n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \\n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\\n\\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\\n\\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \\n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \\n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \\n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \\n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \\n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \\n     penetrated?\\n\\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\\n\\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian\\'s ammunition\\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \\n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \\n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \\n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\\n\\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\\n     crush a reporter\\'s car which had been left at the compound.  Is \\n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \\n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\\n\\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \\n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \\n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \\n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \\n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \\n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \\n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \\n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \\n     shots from high-power rifles?\\n\\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\\n\\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?\\n-- \\n**************************************************************\\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\\n**************************************************************\\n',\n",

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I\\'ll give \\nyour question a shot. \\n\\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \\nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \\n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \\npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \\ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\\n\\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \\nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \\nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \\nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \\n\\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I\\'m assuming that the DeskJet can, or \\nHP wouldn\\'t sell many......\\n\\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \\nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\\n\\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200\\'s resolution.  It looks like \\na good laser quality print.  The HP\\'s I\\'ve used.....they look like ink.  Not \\nas impressive.  \\n\\nSo, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?\\n',\n",

With every truthful and good message that\\ncarries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable\\nfact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted\\nway, with inevitable consequences.\\n\\nThe Bible\\'s message is that we are to love all people, and\\nthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of\\nrepentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have\\ndeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message\\naround and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.\\nThis is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.\\n\\nOne of the problems is that you look at the world through\\nthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find\\nmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated by\\npeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying\\nthis to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely\\npointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.\\n\\nConsider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we\\nwould have the same freedoms in the countries in which we\\nlive, if it wasn\\'t for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.\\nPerhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion\\n(I won\\'t name any here, though one comes to mind) which\\nwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such\\nsubjects.\\n\\nPoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for\\npower, greed and hatred.

I think there are very\\nfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.\\n\\n> This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming\\n> that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.\\n\\n> >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical \\n> >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding \\n> >Biblical interpretation.\\n> \\n> So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate \\n> the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  \\n\\nBut you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you\\ndetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can\\'t agree how\\nto interpret the Scripture?  \\n\\nIt\\'s very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based \\non your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own\\nbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the \\nBible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that \\nyou in fact interpret?\\n\\nCarol Alvin\\ncaralv@auto-trol.com\\n',\n",

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n> The same\\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.

I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5\\n(the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how\\nshould I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation\\nprogram recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to\\nIRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now\\nI have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this \"cascade to\\nIRQ8-15\" business?  \\n\\nA related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that \\nonly DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about\\n32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus\\nextension to do 32-bit DMA?\\n\\nYet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang\\nthe machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??\\nCivilization however works fine ( at least so far).

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon\\'s HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\\\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient\\'s infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies\\' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We\\'re delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother\\'s body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers\\' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.

In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\n  discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\n  race and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\n  name.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\n  its informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\n  be a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\n  American-themed name.\"\\n\\n  https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  - When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n    should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n    by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n    lower because it is more realistic.\\n  - This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n    applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n    above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n    as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n    that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n    should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n    output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"

       "'\"With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i\\'ve started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ\\'s feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m\\'kay.<br /><br />Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci\\'s character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ\\'s music.<br /><br />Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ\\'s bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention i\\'ve gave this subject....hmmm well i don\\'t know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.\"'"
